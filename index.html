        <h1>One More Until Forever</h1>
        <p>I humbly introduce to you all... <strong>"One More Until Forever"</strong></p>
        <p>This album started as a lifeline, a journey I started about 4 years ago, alone in my room back in the Bronx. I was at my lowest, chasing hope through late-night sessions, every song trying to make sense of the weight I was carrying. Now, as I finish it in a cafe in Tokyo, happier than I've ever been, realizing that this isn’t just music—it’s a story, written instrumental by instrumental, checkpoint by checkpoint.</p>
        <p>Each song is a snapshot of my life, every instrument a chapter, every rhythm a memory. These aren’t just random songs; they’re pieces of my journey, fragments of growth, obsession, and the relentless search for something that disproves the notion that nothing is forever.</p>
        <p>One More Until Forever grabs every attempt, every failure, and every small success. It’s my way of praying, hoping, and pushing through, just to be “one more” closer to something lasting. Now, sitting here, I feel like I’ve finally found peace, not the end, but a sense of grounding. And so, I offer you a piece of my story, a glimpse into that journey.</p>
        <p>From a quiet room in the Bronx to the lights of Shibuya, this is my path to healing and discovery. I hope these songs speak to you, hold you, and remind you to keep going, even if it’s just one more until forever.</p>
